# Undux memory bench

Before, Undux only supported the `createStore` API for creating stores. This API is dead simple, but has the significant drawback that it leaks memory. With a large store, this memory leak can be severe:

The updated Undux `createConnectedStore` API correctly deallocates a store once it's no longer referenced:

## Running the profile yourself

```sh
cd perf/memory
npm install
npm run watch
```

1. Open _http://localhost:8081_ in Chrome
2. Record an initial memory snapshot
3. Press _Allocate_
4. Record memory snapshot
5. Press _Unmount_
6. Record memory snapshot

Expected: Memory allocation in (2) and (5) should be roughly equal.

## TODO

- [ ] Automate this, and run it as part of CI
